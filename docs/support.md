This link isn't implemented yet -- but imagine it might take you to a place where you can purchase all of or fractions of an NFT that supports the content creator and the game developers (and anyone else they attribute in their work).

We can reuse a number of different existing projects' work here: Mirror's splits, fractional NFT projects like Fractional and Spectre, etc.
